  abstract = {Bioconductor is a widely used open source and open development software project for the analysis and comprehension of data arising from high-throughput experimentation in genomics and molecular biology. Bioconductor is rooted in the open source statistical computing environment R. This volume's coverage is broad and ranges across most of the key capabilities of the Bioconductor project, including  importation and preprocessing of high-throughput data from microarray, proteomic, and flow cytometry platforms  curation and delivery of biological metadata for use in statistical modeling and interpretation  statistical analysis of high-throughput data, including machine learning and visualization,  modeling and visualization of graphs and networks.  The developers of the software, who are in many cases leading academic researchers, jointly authored chapters. All methods are illustrated with publicly available data, and a major section of the book is devoted to exposition of fully worked case studies. This book is more than a static collection of descriptive text, figures, and code examples that were run by the authors to produce the text; it is a dynamic document. Code underlying all of the computations that are shown is made available on a companion website, and readers can reproduce every number, figure, and table on their own computers. Robert Gentleman is Head of the Program in Computational Biology at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. He is one of the two authors of the original R system and a leading member of the R core team. Vincent Carey is Associate Professor of Medicine (Biostatistics), Channing Laboratory, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School. Gentleman and Carey are co-founders of the Bioconductor project. Wolfgang Huber is Group Leader in the European Molecular Biology Laboratory at the European Bioinformatics Institute in Cambridge. He has made influential contributions to the error modeling of microarray data. Rafael Irizarry is Associate Professor of Biostatistics at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. He is co-developer of RMA and GCRMA, two of the most popular methodologies for preprocessing high-density oligonucleotide arrays. Sandrine Dudoit is Assistant Professor in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of California, Berkeley. She has made seminal discoveries in the fields of multiple testing and generalized cross-validation and spearheaded the deployment of these findings in applied genomic science.},

  abstract = {Near-infrared (NIR) and mid-IR spectroscopy applied to soil compositional analysis started to develop markedly in the 1990s, taking advantage of earlier advances in instrumentation and chemometrics for agricultural products. Today, NIR spectroscopy is envisioned as replacing laboratory analysis in certain applications (e.g., soil-carbon-credit assessment at the farm level). However, accuracy is still unsatisfactory compared with standard laboratory procedures, leading some authors to think that such a challenge will never be met. This article investigates the critical points to be aware of when accuracy of NIR-based measurements is assessed. First is the decomposition of the standard error of prediction into components of bias and variance, only the latter being reducible by averaging. This decomposition is not used routinely in the soil-science literature. Contrarily, a log-normal distribution of reference values is very often encountered with soil samples [e.g., elemental concentrations (e.g., carbon)] with numerous small or zero values. These very skewed distributions make us take precautions when using inverse regression methods (e.g., principal component regression or partial least squares), which force the predictions towards the centre of the calibration set, leading to negative effects on the standard error prediction \textendash{} and therefore on prediction accuracy \textendash{} especially when log-normal distributions are encountered. Such distributions, which are very common for soil components, also make the ratio of performance to deviation a useless, even hazardous, tool, leading to erroneous conclusions. We propose a new index based on the quartiles of the empirical distribution \textendash{} ratio of performance to inter-quartile distance \textendash{} to overcome this problem.},

  abstract = {Premise of the Study Dimensions and spatial distribution of vessels are critically important features of woody stems, allowing for adaptation to different environments through their effects on hydraulic efficiency and vulnerability to embolism. Although our understanding of vessel development is poor, basipetal transport of auxin through the cambial zone may play an important role. Methods Stems of Populus tremula \texttimes alba were treated with the auxin transport inhibitor N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) in a longitudinal strip along the length of the lower stem. Vessel lumen diameter, circularity, and length; xylem growth; tension wood area; and hydraulic conductivity before and after a high pressure flush were determined on both NPA-treated and control plants. Key Results NPA-treated stems formed aberrant vessels that were short, small in diameter, highly clustered, and angular in cross section, whereas xylem formed on the untreated side of the stem contained typical vessels that were similar to those of controls. NPA-treated stems had reduced specific conductivity relative to controls, but this difference was eliminated by the high-pressure flush. The control treatment (lanolin + dimethyl sulfoxide) reduced xylem growth and increased tension wood formation, but never produced the aberrant vessel patterning seen in NPA-treated stems. Conclusions These results are consistent with a model of vessel development in which basipetal polar auxin transport through the xylem-side cambial derivatives is required for proper expansion and patterning of vessels and demonstrate that reduced auxin transport can produce stems with altered stem hydraulic properties.},
